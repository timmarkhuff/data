Also, I wanted to tell you that I ordered several bottles of the 04 Merlot sale wine and it was bad.  Has anyone else complained?  The first one I drank wasn't great but it definitely wasn't as bad as the second bottle I opened which I had to throw away.  Don't know about the 3rd....I'll try that one soon and let you know.
I'll look forward to receipt of this shipment

There was people inside but the shop was closed. (before Christmas & after New Years)  We only live part time in Pacific Grove so it is a very long trip.  This is the third time that this has happened to us.  WE ARE SADLY DISAPPOINTED.  My husband suggests we stop using your wine club.  He said we can just walk across the street to the other winery
